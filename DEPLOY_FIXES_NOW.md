# 🚀 DEPLOY BACKEND FIXES TO VERCEL

## 🎯 Issue Identified
The frontend is calling the deployed Vercel backend which has OLD code without our fixes:
- ❌ Deployed: Honorific = undefined, Courses = undefined  
- ✅ Local: Honorific = "Prof.", Courses = ["BIT364", "BIT301", "CS101"]

## 🔧 Fixes Made (Need Deployment)
1. ✅ Enhanced `/api/auth/me` endpoint with full profile data
2. ✅ Fixed duplicate routes in attendance.js
3. ✅ Updated user profiles with proper honorifics and courses
4. ✅ Fixed attendance API to return proper lecturer information

## 🚀 Deploy Commands

### Option 1: Git Push (if connected to Vercel)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Enhanced user profiles with honorifics and courses, fixed attendance API"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Manual Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Redeploy from latest commit
3. Or connect to this repository

## 🧪 Verify Deployment
After deployment, test:
```bash
node test-frontend-integration.js
```

Should show:
- ✅ Lecturer Name: "Kwabena Lecturer"  
- ✅ Full Name: "Prof. Kwabena Lecturer"
- ✅ Courses: ["BIT364", "BIT301", "CS101"]

## 📋 Files Changed (Need Deployment)
- `routes/auth.js` - Enhanced /me endpoint
- `routes/attendance.js` - Fixed duplicate routes  
- `scripts/updateUserProfiles.js` - Profile update script
- Database - Updated user profiles

Once deployed, the frontend will immediately show the correct data! 🎉
