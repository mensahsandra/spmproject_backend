## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the Endpoints**: Use the provided cURL commands or Postman

3. **Frontend Integration**: The frontend is already configured to use these endpoints

4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Email notifications for new quizzes
   - Real-time grade updates
   - File download endpoints
   - Quiz analytics dashboard

## üìù Notes

- File uploads are stored in `uploads/quizzes/` directory
- The implementation uses in-memory storage for demo purposes
- In production, integrate with your MongoDB database
- Student filtering logic can be enhanced based on your attendance and enrollment systems

The backend is now fully compatible with your frontend Quiz Management interface! üéâ
